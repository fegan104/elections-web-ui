## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Local Development

When developing the API urls are automatically set by .env files to point to `localhost:8080`. The easiest way to configure a local elections-api server is by following the [Docker configuration guide](https://github.com/fegan104/elections-api).

## Technologies

This web app is a statically exported Next.js project with hosting and authentication provided by Firebase. Details on the back end elections-api can be found in a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/fegan104/elections-api).
